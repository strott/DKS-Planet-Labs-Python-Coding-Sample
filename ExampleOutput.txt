This is my first python script, it was written using Python 3.4 on Windows 10.
This script uses a local copy of the dictionay that was stored at /etc/dictionaries-common/words (symlinked to /usr/share/dict from an Ubuntu 15.04 virtual machine.
The dictionary file contains just under 100000 words will be handled by this script.

Assumptions made by this program:
1. Words from the dictionary that start with a capital letter (proper names and other junk at the start of the file) are ignored.
2. Characters with accents are stripped of their accents (ex. Angstrom, eclair).
3. Words that end with "'s" (any word that has a possessive form) are ignored.
4. Words that contain less than 4 characters are ignored.
5. The input file is alphabetized to maintain table insertion function simplicity and to keep the Big-O time from getting out of control.
6. The input file has one word per line (i.e. is \n delimited).
